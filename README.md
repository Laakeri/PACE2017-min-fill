#Minimum fill-in solver

Implementation of exact minimum fill-in solver for PACE challenge 2017 https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/

Details of the algorithm are in the ALGORITHM file.

#How to use

Build the code with the makefile provided.
Run with ./main
The solver reads the input from the standard input and outputs the solution to the standard output. The output format is always the PACE 2017 format: each line contains description of one fill edge. Description of an edge is its endpoints separated by a space. The solver supports multiple input formats. All input formats present in the instances directory are supported.
